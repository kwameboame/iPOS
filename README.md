# iPOS

iPOS is a python script that simulates a POS system when you run it in a CLI. It was built as part of a bigger inventory management and sales recording system.

The script contains sample data in a dictionary and two scripts: expired() and order().

##### Sample data
Check the expiry dates of the sample products in the sample data and change them if they have expired.

##### expired()
Checks if the item being sold is expired

##### order()
Processes the order; records sales and updates inventory.
